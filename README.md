# random_quote_generator
A random quote generator - DevTask 3

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/b084bf29-2fba-43b9-93dd-58cf14073b31/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/tamsay-random-quote-generator/deploys)


This is the third project in the DevTask project series. The app is a simple random quotes generator with the ability to choose from eight (8) different quote categories. There is also a random category as well.

An API was used in getting the quotes and it can be found here courtesy of [LukePeavey](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable). Everything was done with vanilla js, html and css; no framework was used in the project
